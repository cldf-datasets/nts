##  Original page description

The Nijmegen Typological Survey (NTS) is a large database of grammatical properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials (such as reference grammars) by a team directed by Stephen C. Levinson. The original questionnaire was designed by Ger Reesink and Michael Dunn, subsequent extensions and clarifications were done by Hedvig Skirgård, Suzanne van der Meer and Harald Hammarström

##  Changes

The original field *comment* of table *ntsvalue* contains several erroneous encoded characters. While generating the CLDF dataset efforts have been made to correct these errors as far as possible.
