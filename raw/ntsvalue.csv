912,"Tricky question because the analysis of the classifier complex into separate tense prefixes, pronominal prefixes and classifier is very difficult and results in highly abstract morphemes and multiple classifier allomorphs, so at some levels McGregor treats the prefixes plus classifier as a single portmanteau morpheme but at another level he tries to analyse them. In any case the tense prefixes plus the pronominal prefixes would not be said to form a portmanteau separate to the classifier (verb) root. McGregor (pers. comm.) agrees it is a tricky question and gives this example: take ngabga âhe eats itâ. At one level of analysis one could say that the ga is a portmanteau of 3sgNOM+3sgACC and PRES, and the âA classifier. Or take wardngiri âI goâ, with ngiri indicating 1sgNOM/PRES and the I classifier â and it is not at all clear how one would divide it up into morphemes.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

1261,There are number-marking suffixes which occur on transitive verbs. These can encode the number of either A or O (determined by a number hierarchy). These can co-occur with prefixes that encode the person and number of O. Thus the number of O may be marked by both a prefix and a suffix (p.131). The number categories distinguished are slightly more fine-grained in the suffixes than in the prefixes. e.g. d-itmer-dare [1/2non.sgO-ask-Perf.Paucal] (p.131-132) is the verb 'ask' specified for a first or second person paucal object. The prefixes encodes nonsingular number and the TAM+number suffix specifies that this is paucal number rather than any nonsingular number.,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

In the non-future, the verb is marked with gi-nga (ie has the form of a negative predicative adjective) and core NPs are in genitive case; in future, the verb takes the âka ending which is both a future tense form and the Dative case form, and the core NPs take Dative case; the future negative also requires the separate form âlawngaâ no.

McGregor states most Gooniyandi verbs(process) can occur in any transitivity, but in the examples he gives on p.321 for 'see' it combines with different classifiers (which are defined as the verb for the purposes of this survey). However McGregor (pers. comm.) notes that in fact the same verb(process) plus classifier can be transitive or intransitive in many cases. For example, milaa can mean either âhe seesâ or âhe sees itâ; can also mean â(the sun) is shiningâ or â(the sun) shines on itâ.

4572,Kennedy (1985c:107) syas that there are 'numerous instances' of the same verb root being used intransitively and transitively but when a verb root does this it belongs to the two different conjugation classes (because intransitive and transitive verbs constitute the two conjugations). Since such a verb root takes different TAM and number suffixes when used transitively and intransitively we would have to say that there is morphological marking of transitive vs. intransitive use. Lesley Stirling (pers. comm.) concurs: This is correct. There are a range of differences including end vowel of root verb (or maybe better seen as presence of a transitivising marker) plus different number agreement suffix plus different TAM suffixes.,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

6461,"Referred to as 'verbal complexes' see pp.302-312. Both verbs must have the same final inflections. They may differ in transitivity but have the same subject. There are three types: one in which one verb functions as an adverb, one in which one verb functions to predicate associated motion and one in which one verb functions to encode aspect. There are also some idiomatic combinations listed on p.308.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
6462,,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
6463,"When two verbs are used in a single clause and the first adds aspectual meaning I analyse them as serial verbs. The first verb in the example shown is used to encode aspect and occurs in the present tense although the tense of the whole clause is past continuous, as indicated by the TAM suffix of the second verb.||This is an area of Mawng syntax on which I am still working.

6464,A second verb can be encliticised to the first complex verb formation. Examples show use of simple intransitive verbs as second verbs only. This second verb can add different types of meanings. e.g. me-marda-purl-nu-ngu [1sg.XIII(REFL)-belly-wash-FUT-1sg.LIE] 'I will wash my bellly while lying down' (Walsh 1976a:239). See examples in Blythe (forthcoming a:pp.3-4) in which the second verb adds aspectual meaning 'progressive'. He describes these structures as serial verbs in Blythe (forthcoming b).

6491,"There are clearly serial verb constructions which involve a closed class of 11 'adverbs' one of which can be used alone as a verb: numbu:nggi 'return, go home' (Crowley p.102). These so-called 'adverbs' follow the main verb directly. Both verbs bear the basic TAM inflection. However, the second verb may also carry further TAM markers. For example, yangine-:n juwi-ja-:n-du [bring-PST.INDEF do.downwards-REM.PST-PST.INDEF-HAB] 'bring down' (e.g. (69) p.102). An open class of adverbs which are clearly nominal can also participate in serial verb constructions after taking a verbalising suffix. Sharpe (pers. comm.) notes there are some serial constructions in which the first verb is a motion verb which have the meaning 'go and do V'.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
6492,"The use of a number of verbs in a row is refered to as 'serialization' (p.55). However, it is not claimed that there are serial verb constructions as such in the language. There is no reduction of inflection in 'serialized verbs'.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
6493,"These are very common, occurring in between every one in three and one in eight clauses, depending on genre. Both verbs are fully inflected. They may be a causative construction in which case the O of one is the S of the other. Or there may be S/A=S coreference between the first and second verb. In this type the second may express manner of movement in which case the second verb must come from a restricted set or it may express aspect. Or the two verbs can express a complex event (p.76). Occasionally three verbs are serialised (p.81).",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
6494,Some examples are given of a construction in which a telic verb inflected for TAM follows an uninflected atelic verb within the verb complex. These only occur with some atelic plural stative verbs which carry no tense marker (Nick Piper pers. comm.) e.g. (3.65) wi na-kasir  weret-lare. [ 3nsgS 3nsgS-be.going.along Pl.verb?-nPresPl] âThey were going along.â This looks like a serial verb construction because the verb carrying the main meaning of the predicate is not inflected for TAM but another verb (whose meaning seems to be unclear judging from the gloss) is inflected. Alternatively this could perhaps be analysed as an auxilliary construction but then I think both verbs would have to be inflected for TAM.,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

You also get serial verbs denoting multiple actions:  Niya warnawu jitha wurdaljin 'he cook eat meat-ACC'.

It is interesting that these so-called auxiliaries may mainly contribute aspectual meaning, much in the way that in two-verb constructions in other Australian languages, a basic stance or motion verb may contribute aspectual meaning. For example, Walsh (1976a:228) gives this description of the meaning of the auxiliary he refers to as 'HAB':(a) action takes place over a period of time||(b) action is repeated frequently.

8135,"(Note: changed coding to 'N' as Nick says these phenomena only occur in a very small number of verbs and are really only of historical importance). The combination of a 'prepound' and a verb root may occur within the verb stem (p.336). The prepound as defined by Evans may be an incorporated noun. Some prepounds however, are words which are restricted to occurring as part of the verb stem, combine with certain common verb roots and do not always have a very easily definable meaning outside of particular combinations. In these respects they are similar to the noninflecting element of complex verbs in other Australian languages, often described as 'coverbs', and the verb adjuncts of PNG languages, although those are most often to some extent independent phonological words. Some of the dedicated prepounds in BGW are described as spatial prepounds (p.339) such as djong- which occurs in the verbs djong-di  [with verb root 'stand'] 'be inside something tight-fitting' and djong-bu [with verb root 'hit'] 'put on clothes'. Others do not have a spatial meaning such as -mad which occurs in the verb stems -mad-di 'stay in one place' and -mad-bu 'wait'. Note that Evans (pers. comm.) does not agree with my treating these prepound-verb structures as analogous to coverb-verb structures in other Australian languages (but c.f. coding of Gooniyandi and Murrinhpatha).",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
8136,No mention of them.,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
8137,"There are a small number which suggest that at some point in the past verb-adjunct constructions occurred (Mushin p.c.). There are complex verbs that form a single morphological and phonological word. These involve the compounding of a word with the verb da- 'hit, kill'. The first element may be independently attested as a verb or noun or may not be found elsewhere. The meaning is usually not predictable e.g. waka-da 'wash' in which the first element is independently attested as the verb waka- 'call out in anger' (Belfrage:5.2.2).",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
8138,"The verb phrase has two obligatory elements which form a single phonological word (p.191), the first is referred to by McGregor as the verb or process and the second one is referred to by McGregor as the classifier. The classifier forms a portmanteau morpheme with argument prefixes and some tense markers - these can only sometimes be untangled. I refer to the first element as the process in this questionaire and the second as the classifier. There are only 12 classifiers and the classifier and process are bound together in various ways (p.195). It is a bit hard to say whether the process or the classifier is the predicating element as they combine to form a complex verb. In other Australian languages with complex verbs the element which the pronominal prefixes attach to is referred to as the verb so I treat the classifier as the verb for questions about verb morphology as it is the element to which pronominal prefixes and tense prefixes attach (p.203). For some other questions I treat the entire verb phrase as the verb. In the section on non-finite clauses I treat the process as the verb, as the classifier does not appear in non-finite clauses.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

8142,"I call these 'coverb constructions' following the Australianist literature. These vary in terms of the combinatory possibilities of the verb and coverb and semantic transparency. Around 40 verbs participate in coverb constructions out of a total of 700 verbs recorded. Around 300 coverbs have been recorded. Three-quarters have only been recorded in a single verb-coverb combinations. Some coverbs seem to have an identiifiable underlying meaning but most do not, rather meaning is associated with the entire coverb construction. A small number of coverbs are zero-derived from nouns while many appear to be derived from ideophones.||Examples of coverbs which occur in more than one coverb construction:||||punim 'bend/turn (?)'||Coverb construction with intransitive verb -mi 'do, be, say' means 'bend over' ||Coverb construction with transitive verb -aka (tr.) 'throw, push' means 'turn over'||||rtalk 'no identifiable underlying meaning'||Coverb construction with intransitive verb -u 'lie'  'be large' ||Coverb construction with transitive verb -ma 'get, take' and lexicalised dummy 3rd person Masculine agreement forms complement taking predicate meaning 'start'",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

8172,"Green: 10-11. It is not clear from the description how important these constructions are in Burarra. Green mentions that they are relatively few in number compared to in the Northern Kimberley group. The only uninflecting elements shown in examples are english loanwords and 'abstract nouns' which can also occur independently:marn.gi 'knowledge', jal 'desire, love, liking', jama 'work'. Green states that some words only occur as uninflecting words but that it is not worth setting up a separate word class just for them. Also mentions that -ni 'be (sitting), stay' and -nega 'make' are the most common inflecting verbs used in these constructions. It is not clear whether any other verbs occur.There are quite a few examples in Glasgow and Garner (1980) of expressions using noun and verbs combined. However, detailed work is needed to determine which are really verb-adjunct constructions and which are simply verb-noun idioms. For example, the combination of the noun mipala 'eye' and verb -ngana 'have eyes open' meaning both 'be alert' and 'anxiously await a loved one' (p.47). We find also use of the noun gochula 'stomach' with the verb -rra 'spear' for 'promise  someone' (p.49).

The only verb used to predicate existence or location that is a stance verb is  -muwu ~ -miringarra 'sit, live' (Lee 1987:284).

11813,"Probably the same orders are possible within finite subordinate clauses, as finite subordinate clauses are loosely related to main clause anyhow. Non-finite subordinate clauses usually only consist of a single word (the verb). In the examples given in which other words occur as well the verb is the last element of the non-finite clause (p.393). McGregor (pers. comm.) concurs: as far as I am aware, no differences. As you say non-finite clauses typically have no more than the verb. For finite subordinate (like main) clauses full quota of NPs and VP is unusual. In the case of finite subordinate, there are too few instances to say more than that the ordering seems the same",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

So as a result the verb must precede all NPs (although some occasionally appear particularly in kinship verb relative clauses).

13665,"Primary stress is usually on initial syllable but may be on second syllable if second syllable has long vowel (Lesley Stirling pers. comm.).  My work on Mabuiag with Bani and Rigsby led to the conclusion that primary and secondary word stress could be identified and that while primary stress was not distinctive it generally occurred on the first syllable, and if not (e.g. when the second syllable had a long V) on the second. There is vowel reduction to schwa in unstressed syllables in some conditions (Lesley Stirling pers. comm.).",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
13666,Secondary stress always falls on a long vowel if it is not in the initial syllable (p.79).,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
13667,"Very marginally: the final syllable of words with an odd number of syllables may or may not receive secondary stress. This is dependent on three factors, one of which is related to syllable weight: whether the syllable contains a vowel nucleus or not (liquids and rhotics may be syllable nuclei) (p.67).",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

13671,"Although Coate and Oates (1970:7) state that stress is initial in monomorphemic words unless there is a long vowel in a subsequent syllable this is not really evidence for weight-sensitive stress patterns, because they do not provide evidence that long vowels are phonemic (which Rumsey does not think is the case, apart from perhaps for /a/). So it seems that they are just noting that stressed syllables which are not initial syllables have long vowels. It is not unusual for stress to affect vowel lenght.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
13672,"Nash(1986):113) states that stress is mainly determined by syllable-position. However, long vowels occur only in initial syllable (p.67) - so there is clearly some relation between syllable weight and stress placement.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

See also Gebdjined ngan-h-ma-ng (cold 1/3-IMM-take-NP) 'I have a cold (lit: a cold gets me) (p.583).||One Kunwinjku verb can incorporate bodily source of pain apparently as subject: e.g. Ngan-yidme-kadju-ng (3/1-tooth-chase-NP) 'My tooth is hurting me' (p.469). This is unusual because it is the only verb recorded as incorporating body parts as transitive subject. There is also a special set of 'predicate adjectives'. These are unusual in that they are only used predicatively and take the normal set of pronominal prefixes found with verbs, whereas other adjectives take a slightly different set when used as predicates. The predicate adjectives all refer to uncontrolled states:  babang 'be sore, sick'||gangemak 'happy', warnyak 'not feel like, not want', banj 'stink(ing)', bonjdjek 'cold', dulmuk 'heavy'  [maybe banj doesn't fit that well] (p.558).",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

These three non-verbal predicates are associated with the case-array S/IO [NOM/ABS - DAT]. They subcategorize for a subject and a dative as do many verbs expressing emotions and mental states (refers to section 12.2.1.3 here). These three are the only non-verbs with this case frame.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

Nominal predicators are unusual in that they can take quasi-arguments when they function as predicates.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
15834,"There are two divalent predicate adjectives: walmeerem 'knowing' and pamngongkom 'ignorant (of)'. These are part of the very small class of predicate adjectives and are the only bivalent ones. However, Alice suggests that what unites them is not being 'uncontrolled' but that they are related to knowledge. They both subcategorise for [NOM, ACC]  so are also part of the relatively small set of predicates that are quasitransitive, as transitive verbs have an [ERG, ACC] case frame. e.g. Engine parr_r pamngongkom  yancm.

15835,Many non-controlled events are expressed by verbs with lexicalised agreement - so their expected subject is encoded differently to other verbs. It may be encoded as object as in the verb -ngartpanpu 'O have headache' or not indexed on the verb at all as in the verb -warlkanyi 'fall' which only shows agreement with a 3rd person Vegetation gender dummy subject. There are also verb-noun idioms in which a nominal such as wuyak 'sickness' seems to play to role of transitive subject. See thesis chapters on lexicalised agreement.,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
15836,"Experiencer object verbs with a 3sg subject are common. e.g. -tyirr 'sweat', -yer 'itch' both inflect for experiencer object and 3sg 'dummy' subject (Walsh 1976a: 2.1.10.4). See article Walsh (1987) which looks at this set of verbs in detail.

15837,For some non-controlled events and states the experiencer is encoded as object or indirect object. e.g.  -rrarawami 'die' has dummy Feminine subject.

15838,One predicate is noted as having a dative experiencer while it syntactic subject is dummy subject or else the particle/coverb acts as subject. Murlrnbun wiyira. (trouble w-fut-be-1sgDAT) I'll get into trouble (lit: trouble will affect me). Note that experiencer is encoded as dative through pronominal suffix while the verb has 3rd person w-gender subject pronominal prefix (one of the two non-human genders). It is not clear whether the subject pronominal prefix is some type of default marker for dummy subjects or reflects the gender of the particle/coverb murlnbun 'trouble' when it is a noun (p.114).,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

16400,"See Comrie (1981:17) who refers to it initially as a 'so-called Antipassive' but then later (p.39) just as an Antipassive'. The A of a transitive sentence becomes an S in the antipassive and the O becomes an oblique marked with the instrumental case suffix. The verb in the antipassive construction has intransitive morphology. However there is a bigger difference in meaning between the normal and antipassive compared to the usual purely pragmatic difference between normal vs. passive or antipassive (Comrie 1981:40). In addition to grammatical and pragmatic changes, the object of the underlying transitive clause of an antipassive construction is usually unindividuated (nonsingular), nonhuman and totally affected. Lesley Stirling (pers. comm.) notes: Yes there is an antipassive as described here from Comrie, I believe, though I donât agree with exactly how Bani & Klokeid describe it.

The marking of the object does not change at all. (p.111, Crowley.). The semantics of the anti-passive in an independent clause seems to be progressive/durative/iterative etc. depending on the semantics of the verb. However, the anti-passive is also used in one of two linked pairs of clauses to avoid a situation in which there will be A-O or A-S coreference across clauses.

Either this is some type of serial verb construction, or it is clause chaining.However it seems like there is only ever one verb lacking inflection, never a chain of them. On p.75 it is suggested that this is really some way of 'spicing' up an utterance like saying 'pow!' - c.f. questionnaire for Ngandi it is possible that these two related languages both have clause chaining or something very like it.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

Crowley (p.118) reports a marker that takes the form -nguy, -ngu or -ng. It occurs on the first constituent or verb of the second sentence in a pair of linked sentences. In addition to apparent different-subject marking uses (e.g. The man is singing and the woman is dancing), it is also used to indicate a logical connection between two clauses (e.g. Squeeze the honey so that you can drink it, or: He got hit on the head and now he's gone crazy).

This means that it is not enough to look at the structure of a particular verb to decide whether it is 'Simultaneous' or 'Successive'. For instance, a verb may be marked with a Durative suffix because the action in itself  is of a durative nature, not because there is an overlap temporal relationship between the Clause where this verb occurs and the following Clause.

20880,"There are 3 noun classes: masculine, feminine, and plural. Plural is never marked for gender, however even for regular nouns, the gender system is covert, only being used for disambiguation of reference and nominal agreement suffixes. If reference to the biological gender of an object is necessary, a second noun follows the head noun, specifically the nouns for ""man"", ""woman"", ""boy"", and ""girl"" Lovestrand (2012: 72). inanimate nouns are lexically assigned grammatical gender. There do appear to be some ""common-gender"" nouns, which can change grammatical gender depending on the context, ie ""heifer"" vs ""bull"".",,Jesse Peacock
20881,"There are 9 singular and 9 plural classes, one 'infinitive' class, one 'diminutive' class, and an augmentative class.",,Jakob Lesage
20882,"There are 6 singular classes (1, 3, 5, 5B, 7 and 9) and 4 plural ones (2, 4, 6 and 8). There is an augmentative class (10) and a diminutive one (11). Classes 5 and 5B are probably in the process of being syncretized.",,Jakob Lesage

A cluster is not possible at the start of a word at least, as all words begin with a single consonant (p.29). Norvin Richards notes: Yes, this is right.  Some of the nasals can get prestopped after another consonant--so a word like walmaan 'high' will sound sort of like walpmaan.

This might seem to suggest that there must be clusters in syllable onset or coda. However, all three-consonant clusters consist  of a homorganic nasal-stop cluster and a glide: /ymp/, /nthy/ , /ngkw/, /nty/. It would be possible to analyse the homorganic nasal-stop clusters as a single prenasalised stop phoneme as Jennifer Lee does for Tiwi and thus analyse the three consonant clusters as two consonant clusters that occur across syllable boundaries (p.321).

23321,"""Clusters occur only in the coda of a syllable.""(p.45).",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
23322,Furby (1974:10) claims that there cannot be a consonant cluster in the syllable coda. She doesn't clearly state it but to support this claim she must analyse syllable boundaries different to morpheme boundary in these examples of verbs with three-consoant clusters (syllable boundary shown by full stop): putjal.m-pa 'smash' and yuwarl.m-pa 'blow' (p.9). It seems more likely that morpheme and syllable boundaries coincide here given the tendency for approximant plus stop clusters to occur in syllable codas of other nearby languages.,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
23323,"Consonant clusters may occur at the end of verb (process) roots: /lg, rlg, rlng, rr.r, rrg and rrb/ (p.73). McGregor (pers. comm.) gives an example of a cluster in the syllable coda. The cluster /lng/ in thoolnglimanhi 'I kicked him'.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

23325,"But first consonant in the cluster must be a liquid and the second a nasal. Clusters in examples on p.67 are /lng/, /rrng/, /lm/ and possibly marginally /rm/",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
23326,CVCC and CVCCC are possible structures for monosyllables (p.44). See also p.54.,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
23327,"Apart from those beginning /rr/, all consonant clusters have an approximant as their first phoneme and a stop as their second phoneme.

23360,"The description of consonant clusters uses the word as the frame of reference rather than the syllable. Few words underlyingly end in a cluster, there is always an underlying vowel than can sometimes be omitted (p.76). However clusters of 3 consonants have been recorded in some words. These are all of the form: lateral+peripheral.nasal+homorganic.stop so are probably best analysed as CC.C clusters since lateral+nasal clusters are a common cluster in the codas of many Australian languages.

23813,"Viktoria Apel (p.c. 2014) that in very few cases, the plural class suffix attaches simply to the singular instead of exchanging the singular suffix:||||(8) a. bar-ki  kin b.  barkii-ji  ɗin||  blessing-17  DEF.17  blessing-4  DEF.4|| ‘the blessing’      ‘the blessings’||||(9) a.  ceeɗ-u  ngun     b.  ceeɗuu-je  ɗen||  dry.season-10 DEF.10  dry.season-3 DEF.3||  ‘the dry season’   ‘the dry seasons’||||I would not analyze the plural forms as having two noun class suffixes. I can rather image that these are loan words (e.g. in the class 17, ex. 8, there are mostly wooden or sharp things). As the loan word has already an ending which is similar to a noun class ending, it entered into it. As for the plural, the word as a whole is analyzed as lexeme, thus the plural suffix attaches to it. That is why the last vowel of the word is lengthened in order to respect phonological rules, there are no cases in which the class suffix can be lengthened.",,Hedvig Skirgård

I can however occur in the postnominal position as well, in that case it functions more like a definite article. It is not entirely clear that we can make the analysis that it is no longer a demonstrative, which is why the Fula languages are coded as (3) and not (1). This postnominal demonstrative/definite article could be what is called an ""anaphoric demonstrative"" in other languages of West Africa, i.e. meaning something like ""the one referred to"". This kind of demonstrative is often best translated into English as definite article, which is perhaps why it is often described as a definite article and not another type of demonstrative.

31753,"Both simple juxtaposition and use of the conjunction rrapa are possible ways of coordinating NPs.

See example 3(xxiv) also: jin-delipa rrapa wana [3Mjin-little and big] 'a big one and a little one', p.29. Examples ii and iii Glasgow and Garner (1980:42) show both simple juxtaposition and use of conjunction rrapa. Inclusory constructions are used when both participants are human, e.g. 4(xxii) an-delipa birrinyji-pa abirri-ny-bamu-na [3M.an-little 3UAfem-CARD 3UA-fem-go.along-PRECON] 'she and a little boy went (together)', p.51 It is not clear what the possibilities for expressing comitative are. There is some evidence that specific comitative verbs are used. Human accompaniment expressed using verb glossed 'go along with' in example 5(x1) p.67 is intransitive with dative object: aburr-malchi-nga burr-wa [3AUG-go.along.with-Realis 3AUG-DAT] 'they went along with them'.

31754,"The locative case suffix can be used with a comitative meaning (see example 2.21 p.42): abi kimyar-ge (3sg.GEN married.male-LOC) 'with her husband'. It is also possible for the associative case suffix to be used with the same comitative meaning (see e.g. 2.23, p.43). Coordinands seem to be juxtaposed and the last one suffixed with the nominal dual or paucal/plural suffixes (p.51). In addition the first coordinand can have the non-singular suffix (p.53). The word 'a' is glossed 'Conj' in example 2.99 on p.55 and appears between two coordinands in addition to the use of both the non-singular suffix and the dual suffix on the two nouns. Inclusory constructions also occur, with the subset term marked either with a nominal number suffix or the associative case marker (p.51-52).",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

However comitative constructions can be created through the use of two different comitative/proprietive suffixes (p.348). there is also a privative suffix (p.349).

31811,The particle galimba is used to conjoin two NPs much like the English 'and' . Inclusory constructions occur (p.308). No discussion of comitative constructions in grammar section but lines 1 and 2 of Text 9 on pp.331-332 suggest that the 'bare oblique' form can be used as a comitative case form (oblique class/case prefix and no case suffix). One example is nyawul-nyimbi nga-'nj-anji [Obl-they 1sg-RDP-sat] 'I sat with them'.,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
31812,"The suffix -pula 'and, dual' (p.128) is be used in NP coordination. It is also used on the subset of inclusory constructions (p.128). There is a construction described on p.41 as a 'having' derivative which seems to cover both comitative and possessive/proprietive uses. Examples are given of 'I am going this way with my dog' (comitative-type use) as well as 'one who has a car' (possessive/proprietive type use). So I have included this construction involving the suffix -wij and optional prefix barta- in this section and in the section on possessive constructions.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
31813,"For comitative meaning the locative/instrumental case suffix is used on all words apart from pronouns which take a special comitative suffix (p.162, 165).

31814,The particle ga can be used to conjoin nominals but is very uncommon as they are usually just juxtaposed. The inclusory construction is also used p.112.

Restricted includes both inclusive and exclusive meanings - see 2.2.01a (free pronouns) or p.207 (pronominal prefixes). However, McGregor (pers. comm.) notes that he has suggested other analyses since then and the one which works best is a type of inclusive/exclusive distinction based around the inclusion or exclusion of >1 hearer. However, this is not what is usually understood as an inclusive/exclusive distinction so I have coded this question as 'no'. There is also a rarely used oblique pronominal enclitic -ngangi used to refer to first person dual inclusive set (p.225). However, this does not contrast with an exclusive form.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

For example, the free pronoun ngidi (1st person plural restricted - R) can be used to refer to either first person dual inclusive (1+2) or as a dual/plural exclusive (1+3(pl)). The free pronoun yaadi (1st person plural unrestricted - U) refers to a group consisting of at least a first, second and third person (minimally 3 people)(p.167). The first person plural bound pronominal prefixes (p.207) and oblique enclitic pronominals (p.224) operate on the same restricted/unrestricted system . McGregor (pers. comm.) notes that the system is not unique â shared with Bunuba also. The same system is found in the Niger-Congo language YaourÃ© (Hopkins, Elizabeth B. 1986.

33364,Free pronouns neatly fit the minimal-augmented analysis. The type of minimal-augmented system they have is described by Bowern (p.40) as an Ilocano system because the forms for 1st and 1+2 person seem to be based on the same stem. In the verbal subject prefixes there is a single augmented form used for both 1 and 1+2 persons (referred to as an Assiniboine system). This is not exactly the ideal minimal-augmented system.,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

Then there are a couple of other systems, one distinguishing 3 ways between windward/leeward/off to the side (their âover thereâ) and one distinguishing land/up from sea/down; both these also distinguish visible/not + locational/directional + gender.

37502,"Lesley Stirling (pers. comm.): according to Bani & Klokeid there are 4 noun declensions in Mabuiag dialect: a general class, and three smaller classes one of which is female names, one male names, and one a small number of terms for animals. These differ a little in their case marking. Not sure if this is true for Saibai too, and havenât checked it out myself for Mabuiag. Bani suggests female gender is generally the default and this seems true.

When referring to humans, there is a number distinction between bound nominals with third person Masculine and Feminine prefixes (which are used to refer to singular human referents) and those with the third person human plural prefix. ||The Masculine and Feminine gender nominal prefix forms only encode number when referring to humans as they can be used to refer to nonhumans of any number. ||The special human plural prefix is sometimes accompained by the suffix -ut.

With the privative case suffix we get luka-nha-miriw ""inedible/not eaten"" (p.424, section 9.1.2.1). Note that the associative case can also produce object nominalizations as in luka-nha-wuy 'food that has or will be eaten' (p.427).

40933,"This question is coded yes in any case because of the two-way Masculine/Feminine gender distinction in third person singular pronouns (Crowley p.78). However, what appear to be four noun classes marked by suffixes on nouns do not fit Corbett's definition as they do not control any agreement in Waalubal, although they do in some of the other dialects (some adjectives show agreement).  Crowley (30) lists the noun class and number markers for the four genders for the Waalubal dialect. In this dialect they only occur on nouns, never adjectives so are not considered agreement markers. However, in the Casino dialect, Masculine, Feminine and Arboreal (i.e. plant) gender enclitics function as agreement markers on some adjectives (Smythe: 264-6). Crowley (31) notes that data on other dialects suggests they had only 2 noun classes and that Minjangbal had at least optional gender agreement within the NP.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

Most nouns have only one paradigm of possessive suffixes while some can have several:  /aN/ 'tree, wood', /aN-nae/ 'my tree (that I planted or inherited and that I can control the use of), /aN-at/ 'my tree (that I am working on cutting down (regardless of who owes it))', /aN-dat/ 'my tree (the log that I'm sitting on)', /aN-le/ 'my firewood (the wood that I carry on my head) ((the /l/ in this form has to do with the association with the head (class-l2) rather than 'fire'))'; /aba-eat/ 'my pork', /aba-ke/ 'my pig (that I feed and therefore cannot eat)', /aba-nae/ 'my pig (that I or my family group have owed once and therefore cannot own again or eat ever)'.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

43968,Alienable possession involves genitive marking (by way of adding the 'connector' nà) on the possessor; inalienable possession does not (the possessor-pronoun is directly 'attached' to the possessum). A number of lexemes never occur alone: they always need a possessor to be expressed. These lexemes are all inalienable (i.e. body-parts and kinship terms) (Brisson & Boursier 1979: VIII).

44460,"Construction 1: Inalienable nouns take a prefix indexing their possessor  (p.26). Construction 2: Alienable possession is marked by a possessive pronoun which inflects for the person and number of the possessor as well as the person and number of the possessee. Since the possessee is usually 3MIN it is not indicated in the gloss unless some other person/number value, e.g. maanka aambooriny jirr baawa [black people 3AUG.POSS'R child]  'black people's children' (p.35) Constr 2b: this pronoun can cliticise; it seems only to do so for kin terms (Claire Bowern pers. comm.). Construction 3: 'possessor raising': An oblique enclitic pronominal on the verb can index a possessor of an argument (p.204).",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
44461,"Green, p.7 mentions that formation of possessives is different for these three classes of nouns: general nouns, kin terms, body part nouns.  Possession of kin terms is expressed through using the oblique free pronoun stem as a pronominal enclitic, e.g. mampa-apa [mother=1.min.KIN.POSS] 'my mother' (Green:24). A free possessive pronoun can optionally occur with this as well (see p.31). General nouns occur in a possessive construction in which the oblique pronoun is a separate word and has an agreement prefix which agrees with the gender, number etc. of the possessor noun. e.g. mari gun-nika [trouble 3MIN.GUN(gender)-3MIN.POSS.PRO] 'trouble's story (or the story about trouble)' (Green:29). The special body part possessive construction uses a form -jirra related to the verb for stand -ji. It takes a pronominal prefix that refers to the possessor but does not inflect for tense like the verb. An example is mula ngu-jirra [hair 1.MIN-POSS] 'my hair' (Green:31). It is the possessor that is cross-referenced in the verb if a core argument (see example II, Glasgow and Garner p.55). Certain body part nouns may also participate in another construction type, in which they take a prefix agreeing with the gender and number of their possessor, of the same type as verbal and adjectival prefixes e.g. Burdak arr-bama arr-barnyji-ya-Ã¸ [wait 1/2.MIN-head 1/2MIN-put.down-REFL-IRR] 'Wait, let's bow our heads!' (Green:32). See Glasgow and Garner footnote 2, p.60 for examples of different constructions available with body parts.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
44462,"There is juxtaposition of possessor and possessed and there is also the genitive construction. The constructions are identical, the only difference being that the first lacks the genitive suffix (p.73). For example kaba-(ra) lam [banana-GEN leaf] 'banana leaf'. Similarly to English, we can either say banana leaf, or we can say leaf of a banana (tree). Not all pairs of entities can be used in either construction (so maybe there are possessive classes?). Alternatively the meaning of the expression might differ depending on the construction used, e.g. newr-ira kimyar [maiden-GEN married.man] means 'daughter's husband' whereas the same nouns without the genitive marker mean 'unmarried sister-in-law' (p.74).",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
44463,"Construction 1: The genitive suffix can occur on the possessor, e.g. an ngadung-a-Ã¸ in-awula banu-an [3pl.ACC sorcery.stick-PL-PL.ACC 3Sg-GEN aunt-GEN] 'the aunt's sorcery sticks' (Cerin:31). Note that the pronoun takes the core case marker of the NP. (Cerin:25). Construction 2: A pronominal enclitic with the number and person of the possessor encliticsizes to the possessed noun. This enclitic is identical in form to the accusative free pronoune.g. puk-angk=in [case-ALL=3sg] 'into its cave' (Cerin:33).

46384,The most common attributive possession construction involves use of both oblique pronoun and noun for possessor so that order is: possessor(noun)^possessee(noun)^possessor(pronoun). but there are also other constructions allowing just order possessee^possessed or order possessed^possessee (see 2.6.09 above).,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
46385,Part-whole apposition construction is restricted to inalienable possession but no ordering constraints. The only construction with ordering constraints in the proprietive and it is not clear that this construction is restricted to particular classes.,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
46386,"All types of possession tolerate variation in order, although they may have different word order tendencies.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
46387,What I analyse as a part-whole construction (and McGregor categorises as a type of classification) has the order Classifier^Entity (p.252).

46394,Juxtapositional possessive construction is restricted to alienables (Rumsey p.c.). Juxtapositional possessive construction has fixed possessor-possessed word order (p.139). There is a preference for possessed-possessor order in the construction with a possessive pronoun. Rumsey notes that entities which are higher on the Silverstein hierarchy tend to participate in this construction while those lower tend to participate in the genitive postposition construction (p.69).,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
46395,"For the most part the constructions seem to tolerate either order. Order of part and whole in part-whole construction is variable - they occur in different positions in the sentence, not adjacent (Hale 1981).

Examples given of part-whole construction also seem to have possessor-possessed order but there are very few examples given and in one the two nouns are separated. Since they are each case-marked and can be separated by other words we can assume that their order is free and the possessed nominal could precede the possessor nominal in the clause.

46967,"Adjectives are described in the chapter on nominals by Evans because their morphological possiblities are closer to those of nouns than those of verbs (p.133). However, some adjectives can take some verbal morphology when used as predicates. Some adjectives can take pronominal prefixes, the past tense suffix and the irrealis suffix when used as predicates (p.353-357). However, apart from a small set of predicate adjectives (p.558) they take a slightly different set of pronominal prefixes to verbs (see also p.558). In addition, nouns with the privative case suffix used as predicates can also take the two TAM suffixes that occur on adjectives. Life stage nouns such as wurdurd 'child' can occur with pronominal prefixes and the two TAM suffixes (p.556).",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

Ford and Ober (1991) give a more extensive paradigm for Saibai.

46974,"Some adjectives are nominals (noun-like) while others are verbs. Most core adjectives for value, shape and age are nominals. Notably the two basic colour terms differ in word class - see examples below.||Antonym pairs and synonym pairs can cross word classes: -warlkparra 'be white, bright, shiny' is a verb while -ngunji 'black, dark, dirty' is a bound nominal. There are synonyms in different word classes so -arrikpa 'get old, worn out' is a verb while -wugi 'old, worn out' is a noun. Those which are nominals are used in as nominal predicates in non-verbal clauses while those which are verbs are used as verbs in verbal clauses. It is possible to derive an inchoative verb from some adjectival nominals using the suffix -n(y)mi",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"
46975,But some nominals can take a pronominal affix for the subject when used as predicates. e.g. lurruwith-ngi (quick-1sg) 'I'm quick' (Walsh 1996a:343). The pronominal suffix is the same affix used to encode the object argument on verbs.,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

Most of the time, adjectives have a reduplicated form when used attributively with a plural noun--usually the only hint of plurality.  eg: /aba lÃª omba/ 'the big pig' or 'The pig is big.'  /aba lÃª ombomba/ 'the big pigs' or 'The pigs are big.' /aN lÃª sÃªgÃªl/ 'tall tree' /aN lÃª sÃªsÃªgÃªl/'tall trees'.",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

Walsh (1976b) states that the ergative case suffix never occurs both on the noun classifier and the noun of an NP. He also states that it never occurs on both the noun and adjective of an NP. He fails to state generally that it never occurs more than once per NP. However, there are no clear examples of this given. For this reason Murrinhpatha case markers are treated as postpositions for the time being in this survey. Examples (144) and (145) and (373) (p.282) show case markers on the last word of an NP only (Walsh 1976a).

49395,"apparently not, contra what we said in the OL article. I think that was because contra Onishi, the case markers are not really suffixes on the nouns, but clitics which attach to a determiner if present, otherwise to the last element of the NP (see p41). So it's hard to see how they could really be suffixes. There's other problems with the analysis, in that every unmarked NP he calls Absolutive, which means he has to say absolutive NPs can function either as the S argument, or as peripheral arguments, ie what under another analysis would be bare local adjuncts. The syntactic problem with calling your case markers case markers here is that he can't distinguish between core and peripheral arguments syntactically.  Another analysis could be that all the NPs could be PPs marked with postpositions rather than NPs with case suffixes.  Also, I think strong contendors for postpositions are -kori and -no, which Onishi says ''derive nouns in local gender'' [120] But, see 2.9.01; so my answer is - again - Y",,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

In the examples, the case markers usually occur on every element of the NP though. e.g. Ngardu nya:-ni mala:-ni baygal-na:-ni dubay-nyi [I-ERG see-past.def that-ACC man-GEN-ACC woman-ACC] 'I see that man's wife' (Crowley: 70).

50904,"Rachel: There is very definitely a laminal/apical contrast.  The contentious issue is whether or not there is a lamino-dental vs. lamino-palatal contrast.  There is a consistent pattern of alternation between lamino-dentals (before back vowels) and lamino-palatals (before front vowels and word finally).  This has led some researchers to treat the laminals as allophones of a single phoneme (contrasting with apical phonemes).  In Walsh (1976a) he represents this laminal phoneme as âny, ty, etc.â.  Street (1987) represents it as the lamino-dental ânh, dh, etc.â.  There are a few exceptions to the allomorphic pattern (such as tju âinstrument classifierâ) which have led some (including Joe) to argue that actually there should be a phonemic distinction between a lamino dental (e.g. âthâ), an apico-alveolar (e.g. âtâ), a retroflex apical (e.g. ârtâ) and a lamino-palatal (e.g. âtjâ).

Similarly inflection 1 is used for today future while inflection 2 is used for remote future (7.4.1 p.332).,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

Sharpe (2005, p.78) reports -De 'potential' verb inflection for Minyangbal, Gidabal and Casino dialects. It seems to be diachronically related to the ergative case suffix. The inflection is apparently quite rare and it is very possible that it is also found in Waalubal but Crowley simply didn't record it.

53442,This is rather complex but the long and short of it is that the possible combinations of TAM suffixes can only be interpreted as either irrealis or realis. The various TAM suffixes are all either reserved for realis or irrealis meanings. The tense suffixes all imply realis meaning (in the absence of the counterfactual suffix) and in two conjugations there is the option of using a basic realis suffix instead (Green:47). In the same slot we have the apprehensive/imperative suffix which is irrealis. There is also a counterfactual suffix which can follow one of the basic tense suffixes (Green:53). There are two separate pronominal prefix series: one for declarative and one for imperative (Green:35).,,"Michael Dunn, Ger Reesink and Ruth Singer 2009"

Evidence that these verbal number markers also mark arguments is given by examples (40) and (41) discussed by Comrie (1981:12). Where NP to verb case frame mapping is unclear matching of number values of NPs to verb number marking suffix can determine argument mapping. Comrie (1981:13) notes that the verbal number agreement system is very unusual for an Australian language. In most Australian languages with argument agreement on the verb the agreement markers are clearly derived from pronouns and do not have an ergative-absolutive alignment.

For example, se-nek-sap 'it burned me', gÃ¢i-nek-sap 'it cut me', but ZERO-nek-sap 'it saw me'. Reconstruction of the object marking verbs for the HP family will be very interesting. The Ono language (Phinnemores) has the largest class of such verbs. Comparing Ono with Selepet verbs reveals that the 3.s Ono form in the paradigm became a root in another Selepet class, usually class one, what you have as the /ek/ class.
